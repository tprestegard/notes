EFS
---
Can mount EFS locally using AWS DirectConnect or a VPN connection
    - May be useful for local backups of files
    - AWS DataSync (?) Might only be for backup from local to EFS, not the other way around...
    - AWS Backup might be what we want
Performance modes: General Purpose or Max I/O
Throughput modes: Bursting or Provisioned
Check on data encryption:
    "At rest" encryption only available on creation. Can we check if this is done or not?
    "In transit" = TLS and handled when mounting the file system.  Check on how we do this and if it is done or not.
